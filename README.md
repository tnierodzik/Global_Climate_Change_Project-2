# Global Climate Change Project_2

Global warming is having devastating effects on the world; extreme weather, rising sea levels, flooding, droughts and storms are all on the rise. 

Global temperatures have been increasing ever since the Industrial Revolution, and arenâ€™t showing any signs of improvement. It is estimated atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have increased by 47% since 1850. CO2 naturally changes this significantly over a 20,000 year period (from the Last Glacial Maximum to 1850, from 185 ppm to 280 ppm). Large quantities of CO2 are being released in the atmosphere through energy consumption. In 2015, burning fossil fuels accounts for two thirds of all CO2 production. Without any action, global temperature will continue to increase and will dramatically alter the world we live in.  

The detailed map visualizes global temperature changes over time. Map contains several layers to filter and compare temperatures to various factors.
